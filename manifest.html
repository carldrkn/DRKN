  								<p>Contemporary society is in a state of dramatic change, evolving in ways that are often difficult to decode. Through the Internet, online culture has changed our lifestyle by forming new alliances and tribes. The ever-increasing number of people engaged in online gaming worlds is now in the hundreds of million, and counting. A parallel reality is emerging.  Old truths of how the world is organized are quickly losing their significance. Influenced by digital culture, and specifically the online freedom of gaming in exploring matters of identity, online experiences are now merging with offline existence.</p>

<p>This new world is marked by darkness and shrouded in mystery, closely linked to the worlds explored through science fiction. Darkness can be a shelter to hide in, but it can also challenge traditional perception, forcing us to develop new senses and ways of seeing. Its terrain is not yet fully charted, an unmapped landscape with potential to rewrite the future. It is created through our imagination, and we will fight for the continued right to create alternative worlds, open for anyone who wants to join.</p>

<p>As creative minds, we refuse to acknowledge superficial boundaries and rules set up by others. Identity is defined as an ongoing process, where everyone is equal, restricted only by the limitations of their own curiosity. We believe in a world where inspiration is found in unexpected places, and in the process blurring the lines between reality, fiction, genders, generations, ethnicities and social classes.</p>

<p>Rather than being limited to one specific product, we are many things. At our core lies the power of imagination, no longer restricted by past notions of who we once were, but instead set on creating new understandings of who we have the power to become. This is the world now. It belongs to you.</p>
